This project aims to create an intersection between Salsa as a music genre and a movement with the digital humanities. One of this project's objectives is to raise awareness, especially in the Western world, about the African influence on art and culture. Salsa is a great example of that; it combines Latin culture with occidental and African characteristics. The project will highlight that topic, syncretism, and how it became a tool with sociopolitical significance and entertainment value. The history behind Salsa is that the origins of the movement were marked by slavery, and Bomba became the base for it.
In different sections of the website, the cultural and historical importance of Salsa will be explained, as well as the complex historical and cultural dynamics it implies. The project will focus on significant Salsa figures such as Hector Lavoe, Celia Cruz, Ruben Blades, Willie Colon, and Frankie Ruiz, who became symbols for their communities and the world and have a lasting cultural impact today. With this project, I aim to illustrate Salsa's importance through an academic and interactive digital space with relevant data about Salsa and, with that, create a narrative about Salsa with visualization of data; so far, the formats planned for this project include a timeline, images, videos, audio and an essay.
