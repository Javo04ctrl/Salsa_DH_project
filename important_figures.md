He was born in 1946 in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Lavoe was known as one of the most important Salsa performers of all time; he collaborated with Willie Colón, producing some of the most famous and acclaimed Salsa Albums such as "Lo Mato," "Vigilante," "Asalto Navideño," "La Gran Fuga." He also released albums as a solo artist, such as "De ti Depende" and "La Voz."
Lavoe had a difficult life full of substance abuse, infidelities and death. He died of HIV in 1993, but he will always be remembered as an important part of the Salsa genre.
